## Welcome to the Google Developer Student Club (GDSC) Solution Challenge!  Thank you for participating in this challenge to address the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set up by the United Nations. The 17 SDGs help the planet reach a common blueprint for peace and prosperity for our fellow human beings.
Your submissions to the Solution Challenge can use a very wide variety of computing resources and technologies such as mobile devices, user experience design, cloud computing services, databases, smart devices, security controls, machine learning, etc. By collaborating with your teammates, you will use these tools to help you complete your Solution Challenge submission.
You should always remember your role as a developer, which is to solve problems and help users by writing useful software. You have to be a problem solver. You have to understand the user problem deeply to derive a set of possible and viable solutions. And like any good engineer, you have to be aware of the constraints of your environment that affect your possible solutions, such as delivery deadlines, financial issues, computing resources, testing strategies, etc.
